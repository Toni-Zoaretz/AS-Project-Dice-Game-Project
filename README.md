### Game Instructions

â–¶The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he wishes.<br>
â–¶Each result will get added to his roundâ€™s score. But if the player rolls a double six all his roundâ€™s score gets lost. After that, it's the next playerâ€™s turn.<br>
â–¶A player can choose to â€˜Holdâ€™, which means that his roundâ€™s score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br>
â–¶The first player to reach the exact target number points wins.
